		<h1>Chicago Crime</h1>
        <p>For our midterm project, we developed a visual data narrative and evaluated the data set. We chose to explore crime rates in Chicago. We specifically looked at the differences in the number of crimes for those classified
        as non-violent and violent, and how seasonality and specific events in Chicago affect the crime rate as well. Chicago has a long history of having higher violent crime
        rates than other big cities in America, like New York and Los Angeles. Our group was interested in looking at where and when crimes happened in Chicago and how
        different seasons, holidays, and events around the city relate to crimes in different areas. The section below explores where crimes occur, while the <a href="/time">Time Series</a>
        section explores when crimes occur in Chicago.
        </p>
        <p>We think that this information would be particularly useful to police departments to help them strategize where and when to station police officers based 
        on knowledge of historical information of crimes. 
        </p>

		<p>We first wanted to generally look at where and when crimes occur in Chicago. The graph below shows where and what time of day crimes were committed in Chicago from 2012-2016.
			We found that the distributions for when crimes occur were fairly even across the day, however the maximum number usually occurred in the evening around 7 pm. 
			The data also showed that the Garfield neighborhood on the west side of the city had the highest concentration of crime. </p>

		<p>While the "Big Picture" data on when and where crimes occur across the city provided interesting insights, we also wanted to look at how different annual events in 
		the city have an effect on crime. We chose to focus on two events, the St. Patrick’s Day Parade and 4th of July. The St. Patrick’s Day Parade is one of the biggest events
		in the city, and has a set parade route. Many visitors come to the city for this event and the main parade is always followed by another parade the next day, the South
		Side Irish Parade, in a different location in the city. The graph below shows where crime occurs in relation to the Saint Patrick's Day Parade route that is held around Navy
		Pier in the North Side of the city. </p>

    <p>
    We chose to focus on a 15-day time period around the event. That is 7 days the event, the day when the event happened, and 7 days after the event. We averaged the numbers of crimes between 2012 and 2016 for each of the 15 days and showed them in a light grey histogram. An orange histogram illustrates the number of crimes shown in the current view of the map. You can zoom in the map by double click on it and the orange histogram will change accordingly.

	<div class="page-header">
		<p>The graph below shows where crime occurs relative to the Saint Patrick's Day Parade in the south side of the city. While both graphs do show that crimes occur around these events, we found
		that the number of crimes did not increase a significant amount on Saint Patrick's Day and there were no noticeable increases in crime around the parade routes compared to the normal amounts
		at this time of year.</p>

	</div>
	
	<div class="page-header">
		<p> Based on the initial summary of the data (see <a href="/time">Time Series</a>), crimes happened more frequently in summer months. We decided to look at the 4th of July because it
		is one of the most universally celebrated holidays during the summer. The graph below shows the locations of crimes on the Fourth of July around Navy Pier (which is 
		the center of Fourth of July Celebrations in the city).</p>
